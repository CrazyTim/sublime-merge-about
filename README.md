# Sublime Merge vs SourceTree (Git client comparison)

I've stopped using Sourcetree a few weeks ago and haven't looked back.

Here are my reasons why [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com) is far superior in comparison:

- Natively integrates with Sublime text.
- steps to clone a repo is very simple, sourcetree is complex and time consuming.
- sourcetree keeps prompting for repo authentication (very frustrating).
- faster - like rocket vs turtle fast!
- work flow for resolving merge conflicts is more streamlined and has more features.
- doesn't keep crashing and need to be reinstalled (or reboot pc) every time I update Microsoft Office.
- dark theme.
- git commands are behind each button (easy to see how it works).
- easier to see what branch you are on.
- simple right-click to copy the commit number.
- easily inspect the state of any file as of a certain commit.
- back/forward buttons.
- easier to copy text from the changes preview (SourceTree only lets you copy the entire line).
- hide/show individual local/remote branches.
- better find - ctrl-f anywhere, faster, has a query syntax.
- SourceTree window occasionally locks up and you cant resize panels.
- Sublime auto resizes height of commit message text box.
- sublime diff view changes to 2 columns when the window is large enough.
- sometimes in SourceTree when you click a branch it doesn't jump to it in the graph view.
- doing a diff between two different commits in source tree is not always reliable. in sublime merge it is.
- in sublime merge you can see stashes in the graph, source tree you can't.
- interactive rebase is intuitive and simple in sublime merge (multiple select commits and right-click to squash, reorder, amend commit message, etc), while sublime interface is confusing and unintuitive.
