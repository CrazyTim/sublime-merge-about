# Sublime Merge vs SourceTree (Git client comparison)

I stopped using Sourcetree a few weeks ago and haven't looked back.

Here are my reasons why [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com) is far superior in comparison:

- Natively integrates with Sublime text.
- Just like Sublime Text, every action you take is lightning fast. Sourcetree is a turtle in comparison.
- the entire interface is consistent and elegant.
- dark theme.
- Back/Forward navigation buttons.
- Doing a diff between two different commits can be done simply with `Ctrl-click`.
- cloning a repo is wonderfully simple, Sourcetree is complex and time consuming.
- The work flow for resolving merge conflicts is streamlined and has more features than Sourcetree.
- Some buttons have real git commands behind them (hover over to see what will happen behind the scenes).
- Easier to see what branch you are on (prominent front and centre, Sourcetree only bolds the branch name and hard to see with lots of branches).
- Right-click a commit to copy the commit number.
- Easily inspect the state of any file as of a certain commit.
- Easier to copy text from the diff view (SourceTree only allows you to copy the entire line).
- Hide/show individual local/remote branches.
- Powerful find (`Ctrl-F`, faster and more powerful than Sourcetree, and has its own query syntax).
- Commit message text box height automatically resizes (its the little things).
- Diff view changes to 2 columns when the window is large enough.
- You can see stashes in the graph, Sourcetree you can't.
- Interactive rebase is intuitive and simple (`Ctrl-click` multiple commits, then use context menu to squash, reorder, amend commit message, etc), while the same interface in Sourcetree is vauge and unintuitive.

### Sourcetree bugs that make me furious:

- Keeps crashing and need to be reinstalled (or reboot pc), usually just after updating Microsoft Office.
- Keeps prompting for authentication for each repo separately (very frustrating).
- Window occasionally locks up and you cant resize panels.
- Sometimes when you click on a branch it doesn't jump to it in the graph view.
- Doing a diff between two different commits is not always reliable (usually doesnt show all the files that are changed).
